			<h3> What is it? </h3>
			<img src="neonatal.jpg" alt="neonatal" style="border-radius: 60px; display: block;margin: auto;width: 50%;height:auto;">
			<figcaption>Incubator for premature infants</figcaption>
			<p>A neonatal intensive care unit is a unit of hospital specialised in the care of ill or premature new-born infants. They were developed in in the 1950s and 1960s by paediatricians to provide better temperature support, isolation from infection risk, specialised feeding, and access to specialised equipment and resources.[1]</p>
			<h3> Why do infants need one? </h3>
			<p>One of the most important Incubators functions is control of temperature, this is because mammals have the ability of being able to maintain a constant body temperature, but this can be overwhelmed by extreme temperatures, babies have a much smaller range of environmental temperatures they can withstand. Infants have disadvantages in temperature regulation such as: a large surface area, poor thermal insulation, and small amount of mass to act as a heat sink. [1]</p>
				<p>
				<ul>
				<li>They are born too early so they need extra help with breathing, feeding and keeping warm.</li>
				<li>Very small and low birthweight.</li>
				<li>Due to infection.</li>
				<li>Recovery from surgery.</li>
				<li>Complications with the mother such as diabetes.</li>
				<li>Difficult delivery.[2]</li>
				</ul>
				</p>




			<h3>How the incubator controls temperature?</h3>
			<p>There are 2 types of incubators closed and open. Open incubators warm the baby but do not provide any other controlled environment. The advantage of this is that it is easy to access the baby due to the incubator having an open top and has a simple construction. Closed incubators are used more often as open incubator are short term. Closed incubators regulate temperature, humidity and oxygen supply. The temperature is controlled by either manual selection or by skin temperature control. A temperature probe is placed on the baby’s skin and adjusts the heat to keep the babies skin at the desired temperature. However, there are some risks to this control technique, in one case study a baby died due to the incubator overheating. When the baby was to be washed the skin sensor was removed and left hanging outside the incubator, thus the skin sensor detected room temperature 25 degrees Celsius and increased the temperature to 45 degrees. Most incubators have safety measures to prevent this, as there was in this case but the circuit was defective.  [3] In England (2015) 1 in 9 babies born need neonatal care, driven by the increased birth rates and the increased age at which women are having children. But the premature baby survival rate has rose from 40% in 1993 to 53% in 2006 for babies born between 22 and 25 weeks. This shows that with the greater use of these devices in part have lead to a greater survival rate.[4]

			<p>Temperature receptors in the skin detects changes to external temperature and stimulate an impulse to be sent by the nervous system to the hypothalamus centre, that also has blood temperature detectors. The hypothalamus then triggers effectors to respond to this stimulus and try to return the skin temperature back to the norm. [5] </p>

	<h2>Bioreactors</h2>
		<div class=" info">
		<h3> Introduction </h3>
		<p>A bioreactor is any engineered system that utilises supports live organisms within it as part of its function (e.g. hosting bacteria that break down sewage),  but in the context of bioengineering usually refers to any device that can be used to grow micro-organisms or tissue cultures. As such it needs to provide essential nutrients and remove waste by-products in order to maintain the colonies. While this can be done without feedback, creating feedback loops allows specific concentrations of each to be maintained thus maximising efficiency of the system by creating optimum conditions.[1] </p>


	<h3> Overview </h3>
		<img src="overview.jpg" alt="overview" style="border-radius: 60px; display: block;margin: auto;width: 600px;height: auto;">

		<p>The bioreactor consists of a chamber with various connected probes, measuring temperature, humidity, CO₂ concentration and O₂ concentration. The optimum levels for each of these is inputted with suitable parameters on either side. If the value within the bioreactor falls out of this range, the probes relay the information to the various apparatus required in order to bring it back to optimum levels. E.g. if the temperature were to drop too low, the heater would be activated to bring it back up. 
		Usually the ideal conditions are a temperature of 37⁰C, relative humidity of 80%, CO₂ concentration of 5% and O₂ concentration of 20%.[2][3]
		</p>
		<h3> Difficulties with modern bioreactors </h3>
		<p>
			<ol>
			<li>Compared to other fields of engineering etc, creating mathematical models accurately describing cell growth has proven difficult due to the more random nature of cell division. The control system must therefore be robust enough to account for potentially large uncertainties in the model.</li>
			<li>Sensors needed for measuring the different variables within the bioreactor are often not very reliable, meaning submitted data from the system may not be highly accurate, which requires the control system to be able to reject disturbances.</li>
			<li>The growth of micro-organsims is non-linear and will vary greatly over time. The control system will need to be able to use the available measurable variables to estimate future parameters from.</li>
			<li>Changing metabolite concentrations also has a very slow response time on growth which will not be immediately measurable. To prevent metabolite concentration being altered past the point required the system must have a form of predictive control in place.[4]</li>
			</ol>
		</p>
		<h3>How are the different variables measured?</h3>
			<p>
			UV rays are emitted into the bioreactor as it excites NADH/NADPH (which can be found in all organisms) causing them to emit fluorescence. This fluorescence can be measured and give a quantitative figure to help determine the concentration of microorganisms in the bioreactor. 

			Dissolved oxygen concentration can be measured through a number of methods. One of the most common is to titrate samples of the bioreactor mixture at regular intervals against sodium sulphite and calculate the oxygen concentration from the amount needed to oxidise the sulphite to sulphate. 

			A pH probe can easily measure pH. This helps determine carbon dioxide concentration too as we can use knowledge of the carbon dioxide buffer system to calculate carbon dioxide concentration from carbonic acid concentration.[5][6]

	<h2>Pacemaker</h2>
	<div class=" info">

	<p>The heart beats 100,00 times a day [1] and is split into 4 sections the left atrium, the left ventricle, the right atrium, and finally the right ventricle. The left side of the heart supplies the body with oxygenated blood, while the right side supplies deoxygenated blood to the lungs so that it can be oxygenated again creating a cycle. </p>

		<img src="heart.jpg" alt="heart" style="border-radius: 60px; display: block;margin: auto;width: 600px;height: auto;">
		<figcaption>Diagram of a Pacemaker within the body [2]</figcaption>

	<h3> Heart Beat </h3>

		<p> The heartbeat is triggered by the Sinoatrial node (known as the natural pacemaker) that releases an electrical impulse that travels down the atrium causing it to contract and forces blood to flow into the ventricles. Then the Atrioventricular Node delays the impulse to give time for the blood to flow into the ventricles and so the atrium fully contracts. The impulse then travels down Purkinje fibres to the apex of the heart so that the impulse causes the ventricles to contract upwards forcing blood out into the arteries.
 		</p>

 	<h3>What is a Pacemaker?</h3>
 	 <p> Pacemaker takes over the job of the Sinoatrial Node and stimulate your heart to beat. A pacemaker is a small electrical device that is placed in the chest or abdomen to help control heart rhythms. The device prompts the heart to beat at a normal rate of 60-100 beats per minute [3]. 
 	 </p>

 	 <h3>Why would you need one?</h3>

 	 <p>You would need an artificial pacemaker for many reasons, such as: particular type of heart block (a delay in electrical conduction through the heart that slows the heartbeat), heart beats too fast (and not effectively controlled by medication), and finally heart failure (heart pumps out of synch) [4].
 	 </p>

 	 <h3>How the Pacemaker controls the heartbeat?</h3>
 	 <p> Pacemakers were invented in 1932 and since they have evolved from fixed rate pacemakers to demand pacemakers, which only deliver impulses when a missing heartbeat is detected. They consist of a battery, a computerized generator, and wires with sensors on the end. The sensors (or electrodes) detect your heart’s electrical activity and send data through the wires to the computer in the generator [5]. There are many types of pacemaker that measure different aspects of the heart and control the heart rate in different ways. One example of this is a closed loop approach which makes use of a proportional integrative derivative (PID) controller to reach a predefined R-R interval (is the time between heart beats). Another closed loop approach is where the content of venous oxygen is kept under a predefined saturation threshold needed to keep the heart rate under control. Using a closed loop system means that the heart rate is determined by a feedback loop which supplies information about the output [6].
