			<h3> What is it? </h3>

			<p>A neonatal intensive care unit is a unit of hospital specialised in the care of ill or premature new-born infants. They were developed in in the 1950s and 1960s by paediatricians to provide better temperature support, isolation from infection risk, specialised feeding, and access to specialised equipment and resources.</p>
			<h3> Why do infants need one? </h3>
			<p>One of the most important Incubators functions is control of temperature, this is because mammals have the ability of being able to maintain a constant body temperature, but this can be overwhelmed by extreme temperatures, babies have a much smaller range of environmental temperatures they can withstand. Infants have disadvantages in temperature regulation such as: a large surface area, poor thermal insulation, and small amount of mass to act as a heat sink. </p>
			<h3>How the incubator controls temperature?</h3>
			<p>There are 2 types of incubators closed and open. Open incubators warm the baby but do not provide any other controlled environment. The advantage of this is that it is easy to access the baby due to the incubator having an open top and has a simple construction. Closed incubators are used more often as open incubator are short term. Closed incubators regulate temperature, humidity and oxygen supply. The temperature is controlled by either manual selection or by skin temperature control. A temperature probe is placed on the babyâ€™s skin and adjusts the heat to keep the babies skin at the desired temperature. However, the are some risks to this control technique, in one case study a baby died due to the incubator overheating. When the baby was to be washed the skin sensor was removed and left hanging outside the incubator, thus the skin sensor detected room temperature 25 degrees Celsius and increased the temperature to 45 degrees. Most incubators have safety measures to prevent this, as there was in this case but the circuit was defective.  </p>

			<h3> How do adults control their body temperature? </h3>
			<img src="human.jpg" alt="human" style="border-radius: 60px; display: block;margin: auto;width: auto;height: auto;">
			<p>Temperature receptors in the skin detects changes to external temperature and stimulate an impulse to be sent by the nervous system to the hypothalamus centre, that also has blood temperature detectors. The hypothalamus then triggers effectors to respond to this stimulus and alter the skin temperature back to the norm. </p>
