<h1> Treatment </h1>

<h2> General Overview </h2>
<img src="block_diagram.jpg" alt="block diagram" style="border-radius: 60px; display: block;margin: auto;width: 80%;height: auto;">
<div class=" info">
	<p> This block diagram show the process of system control in therapy. Firstly the physicians prescribe a therapy to the patient. This could be drugs, medical device based treatments, or lifestyle changes such as diet and exercise. The physician then assessed how effective the therapy is, by measuring the measurable effects and immeasurable effects. The measureable effects tend to be quantitative, from heart rates to glucose level etcâ€¦, while immeasurable effects is harder to measure, factors such as mood swing, pain. The physicians will take all of these factors into account and modified the therapy to suits the patient. This is an example of feedback.

	Another example of feedback is the controller, the controller can be a medical device, a nurse or dosage of the drugs. The output of the controller is feedback to the physician, and patient also feedback to the physicians using measurable and immeasurable factors. The input to the controller is adjusted, hence this is another example of a feedback loop.

	The feedback patient give, and output from the physicians can be varied. For example the physicians prescribe their patient a drug, and only to visit if there are any problems. This is an open loop system, if the patient do not feedback. While an anesthetic machine would have feedback from measurable factors from the patient to varied the input ( dosage) of the drug.

<h2> The MUSE (Medigus Ultrasonic Surgical Endostapler) System </h2>
	<img div class="MUSE_img" src="Muse_system.jpg" alt="MUSE system" style="border-radius: 60px; display: block;margin: auto;width:500px;height:500px;">
	<div class=" info">
<h3>Introduction</h3>
	<p> The MUSE system is a minimally invasive treatment for GERD ( Gastroesophageal reflux disease). GERD is digestive disorder that affects the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). In a healthy body, the LES open to let food through, and close to prevent the stomach acid flowing back out of the esophagus. However, this is not the case for patients affected by GERD, their LES muscles are weak, or open at unsuitable time. This will cause patient to suffer symptoms such as heartburn, chest pain, difficulties in swallowing, dry coughs and acid reflux.
	</p>
<h3> Overview </h3>
	<p>At first glance, the MUSE System A disposable endoscope with ultrasonic sight and range finder, with CCD camera attached at the end and staples cartridges. The aim of the treatment is to strengthen the LES opening, hence it can contract and close. </p>
<h3> How does it work? </h3>
	<p> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lp_3EdzG3vk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe> </p>

<h3> Why is it an example for feedback? </h3>
	<p> The endoscope have a camera and rangefinder attached at the end. The camera act as feedback to the surgeon, guiding the surgeon through the internal of the body. While the rangefinder emit a standard laser to gauge distance to a high level of accuracy. The laser is received and the distance is determined using the difference between time of sending, time of receival and speed of light. Given the distance the medical practitioner and situation eg. surgery adjustments can be made to capture a larger image.
