<h2> Biofeedback </h2>
<div class=" info">
	<h3> Overview </h3>
	<p>Biofeedback is the process of understanding physiological function using detectors to gain information on activities of specific systems. Processes that can be controlled are muscle tone, brainwaves, heart rate, skin conductance and pain perception. It has been use for more than 50 years in rehabilitation to facilitate normal movement patterns after injury.</p>
	
	<h3> Why it is used? </h3>
	<p>It helps improve health, performance and physiological changes that is caused by emotions, behavior or thoughts. Biofeedback training can improve health issues such as anxiety, asthma, ADHD, constipation, headache, motion sickness, tinnitus, urinary incontinence etc. Most sensors are noninvasive and have a chance to reduce or eliminate medication. The addition of biofeedback to a conventional exercise programme resulted in a significantly shorter time in using a walking aid compared to conventional exercise training alone. [1]</p>

	
	<h3>How is it used?</h3>
	<h4> Sensor </h4>
	
	<p> Electromyograph (EMG) is used to detect muscle action potentials from skeletal muscle that are responsible for muscle contraction. The EMG signal can be picked up using either surface electrodes or by inserting wires or needles to the muscle. The input EMG signals are distorted with a lot of noise from surrounding muscles, therefore the voltage fluctuates. The signals have to undergo rectification, filtering and integration to obtain a unified signal to be able to compare with other processed signals. This information will be displayed on screen in real time. With this real-time audiovisual feedback, individual can learn to invoke positive physical changes like relaxing or tensing specific muscles to reduce pain.[2]  <img src="ecg.jpg" alt="ecg" style="border-radius: 60px; display: block;margin: auto;width: auto;height: auto;"> <figcaption>CAPTION REF 3</figcaption></p>
	<h4>Feedback thermometer</h4>
	<p>It detects skin temperature with a thermistor (temperature sensitive resistor) attached to either a finger or a toe. The temperature of the skin changes accordingly to blood circulation through body tissue. As the temperature changes, the resistance of the thermistor changes. This feedback will be displayed on a monitor. When the patient is in a state of increased exertion, excitement or stress, muscle fibers contract, causing a stenosis of vasculature. This leads to a reduction of skin temperature, since blood circulation through the tissue decreased. In contrast, the musculature will relax when the patient is feeling relaxed causing the vasculature to expand. Hence, the skin temperature rises. A decrease in skin temperature at the hands might be caused by mental stress. This could be harmful in many contexts in modern society (e.g. worries, anxieties). Biofeedback is an established way to learn to control said physiological stress.</p>
	<h3>Why is it an example of feedback in engineering?</h3>
	<p>Biofeedback as a therapy uses sensors to detect physiological changes in a patient’s body such as the heart function, brainwaves, breathing, skin temperature and muscle activity. These signals are processed and displayed as feedback. Individuals learn to control their thinking to support desired changes through the feedbacks from the instruments.[4] </p>
