<h1> Treatment </h1>

<h2> General Overview </h2>
<div class=" info">
<p> This block diagram show the process of system control in therapy. Firstly the physicians prescribe a therapy to the patient. This could be drugs, medical device based treatments, or lifestyle changes such as diet and exercise. The physician then assessed how effective the therapy is, by measuring the measurable effects and immeasurable effects. The measureable effects tend to be quantitative, from heart rates to glucose level etcâ€¦, while immeasurable effects is harder to measure, factors such as mood swing, pain. The physicians will take all of these factors into account and modified the therapy to suits the patient. This is an example of feedback.
Another example of feedback is the controller, the controller can be a medical device, a nurse or dosage of the drugs. The output of the controller is feedback to the physician, and patient also feedback to the physicians using measurable and immeasurable factors. The input to the controller is adjusted, hence this is another example of a feedback loop.
The feedback patient give, and output from the physicians can be varied. For example the physicians prescribe their patient a drug, and only to visit if there are any problems. This is an open loop system, if the patient do not feedback. While an anesthetic machine would have feedback from measurable factors from the patient to varied the input ( dosage) of the drug.
